# DROPS
Cloud computing is characterized by on-demand self-services, ubiquitous network
accesses, resource pooling, elasticity, and measured services. The characteristics of
cloud computing make it a striking candidate for businesses, organizations, and
individual users for adoption. However, the benefits of low-cost, negligible
management (from a user’s perspective), and greater flexibility come with increased
security concerns. Security is one of the most crucial aspects among those prohibiting
the wide-spread adoption of cloud computing. The off-site data storage cloud utility
requires users to move data in cloud’s virtualized and shared environment that may
result in various security concerns. The data outsourced to a public cloud must be
secured. Unauthorized data access by other users and processes (whether accidental or
deliberate) must be prevented. As discussed, any weak entity can put the whole cloud
at risk. In such a scenario, the security mechanism must substantially increase an
attacker’s effort to retrieve a reasonable amount of data even after a successful
intrusion in the cloud. Moreover, the probable amount of loss (as a result of data
attack) must also be minimized.The objective is to provide security to the user data in the cloud storage. For that
we introduce Division and Replication of Data in the Cloud for Optimal Performance
and Security (DROPS) that collectively approaches the security and performance
issues. The proposed schemes fragment the uploaded files and store a single
fragmented data over the cloud nodes. Each of the nodes stores only a single fragment
of a particular data file. So even in case of a successful attack, no meaningful
information is revealed to the attacker. So attackers can’t do anything with the single
fragmented file.Our proposed approach consists of Division and Replication of Data in the Cloud for Optimal Performance and Security (DROPS) that collectively approaches the security and performance issues. We divide a file into fragments, and replicate the fragmented data over the cloud nodes. Each of the nodes stores only a single fragment of a particular data file. The proposed DROPS scheme ensures that even in the case of a successful attack, no meaningful information is revealed to the attacker. We do not rely on traditional cryptographic techniques for data security. The non-cryptographic nature of the proposed scheme makes it faster to perform the required operations (placement and retrieval) on the data.  We ensure a controlled replication of the file fragments, where each of the fragments is replicated only once for the purpose of improved security.
